# Pre-work - **TODOss**

**TODOss** is an android app that allows building a todo list and basic todo items management functionality including adding new items, editing and deleting an existing item.

Submitted by: ** ANUJ ACHARYA **

Time spent: **13** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ 1 ] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list
* [ 1 ] User can **tap a todo item in the list and bring up an edit screen for the todo item** and then have any changes to the text reflected in the todo list.
* [ 1 ] User can **persist todo items** and retrieve them properly on app restart

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ 2 ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file
* [ 2 ] Improve style of the todo items in the list [using a custom adapter](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-an-ArrayAdapter-with-ListView)
* [ 2 ] Add support for completion due dates for todo items (and display within listview item)
* [ 2 ] Use a [DialogFragment](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Using-DialogFragment) instead of new Activity for editing items
* [ 1 ] Add support for selecting the priority of each todo item (and display in listview item)
* [ 1 ] Tweak the style improving the UI / UX, play with colors, images or backgrounds

## Notes

I have to spent some time on setting up list view, it wsa showing from the bottom up instead of top bottom.
I have to restart the design in the sequence in the layout in android studio to get it right.
