Time spent: **4** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

* [ 1 ] User can **successfully add and remove items** from the todo list

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ 2 ] Persist the todo items [into SQLite](http://guides.codepath.com/android/Persisting-Data-to-the-Device#sqlite) instead of a text file

## Notes

I have to spent some time on setting up list view, it wsa showing from the bottom up instead of top bottom.
I have to restart the design in the sequence in the layout in android studio to get it right.
